# Hello, I'm Thanos üëã

## Junior Software Developer | Tech Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a recent graduate of a comprehensive Full Stack Software Development Bootcamp, where I've honed my skills with "hands on" projects in Java, C#, JavaScript, Python, among other cutting-edge technologies.
 
### What I Bring to the Table

üå± **Ever-Growing Skill Set**: From robust backend solutions with Java Spring Boot to dynamic front-end interfaces with Angular, I've cultivated a diverse technical toolkit that I'm eager to apply and expand.

üîç **Passion for Problem-Solving**: I have a natural inclination towards solving complex problems. I believe every issue is an opportunity to learn and improve.

üöÄ **Ready for Challenges**: Thriving in challenge-driven environments, I am always on the lookout for opportunities to push the boundaries of what I can achieve with code.

### My Recent Achievements

- **Full Stack Development**: Graduated from an intensive bootcamp that included both individual and collaborative projects, covering everything from databases to user authentication and API integration.

- **Capstone Project**: Successfully built a [Book Library Full-Stack Application](https://github.com/ThanosTrai/booklibapp-project-springboot) with Java Spring Boot and Angular, featuring JWT authentication and integration with external APIs.
